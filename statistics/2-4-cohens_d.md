[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> On average, the first babies in the sample were slightly lighter (7.201 lb) than others (7.326 lb).  
'''Cohen's d = 0.089''' This is a greater difference than we saw with pregnancy length, but it's still very small! 0.2 is the cutoff for a "small effect", and this isn't even halfway there.
